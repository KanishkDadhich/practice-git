Basic etiquette for open source projects
------------------------------------------

Why we want to contribute to an open source project
1. To fix a bug and want to contribute to make a project better
2. We want to help other people contribute to the project more successfully.
3. We want to improvise our skillset.


Some Basic etiquettes required are :-
1. Being polite and kind to others and avoid offensive language.
2. Thanking people if they help you.
3. Always responding respectfully to your mentors, even if you feel like the answer to their question was a bit obvious, or that they are repeating themselves.
4. Never hesitate to ask something, mentors are there to help you.
5. Help everyone irrespective of their gender, sexuality, experience in open source projects.
6. Reading the manual and instructions is so underrated.
7. Discuss one topic per issue â€” it is easy to keep issues focused and productive.
---------------------------------------------------

Why choosing the effective contributions is so important.
1. Help to improve grammar and make pages more understandable.
2. Help to mentor people that are trying to make fixes.

Dont' s -X
1. Don't try to show off your knowledge, instead help others contributing.
2. Never ever make fun of anybody during the project contributions.



MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE DURING FOSS.
1. It provided me a great platform to improve my skillset and contribute to projects.
2. I developed a habit of helping others who are facing difficulties, which I also inculcated in my real life.
3. The LEADERBOARD really helped me to motivate myself :)

Really glad that I didn't missed this FOSS weekend
